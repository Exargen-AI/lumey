# Changelog — Lumey (Command Center v2.0)

An enterprise-grade, modular, **agentic** software-engineering platform: AI agents
pick up kanban tasks, write & test code, open PRs, and tag humans for review —
with an in-house runtime and SDK built **from scratch, no external agent SDK**.

This log is the single source of truth for *what we've built and why*. Milestones
ship incrementally — each one tested, documented, committed, and (from M2.9 on)
pushed to `Exargen-AI/lumey`. Per-module detail lives in
[`docs/modules/`](docs/modules/); the build plan + decision record is
[`docs/architecture/in-house-sdk-and-runtime.md`](docs/architecture/in-house-sdk-and-runtime.md);
illustrated guides:
[runtime](docs/architecture/lumey-runtime-sdk-guide.md) ·
[SDK](docs/architecture/lumey-sdk-guide.md).

## Foundation (M0–M1) — the kernel & first modules

- **M0 — Kernel** ✅ `496341c` — `ModuleRegistry` (dependency-graph validation,
  entitlement gating, mount + boot), `EventBus` (typed in-process pub/sub),
  `ConfigEntitlements`; **comments** as the first capability module.
- **M1 — Modules & agent control plane** ✅ `929cdf5`, `8819622`, `52bbc48` —
  **notifications** as the 2nd module (subscribes to `comment.created`); the
  agent **Definition-of-Ready** gate; **mixed assignment** (human / named agent /
  agent pool, atomic claim).
- Lean-down to the agentic core ✅ `82c9e21`, `fe9bbe7` — removed
  Exargen-specific features; zero dead code.

## Part A — the Agent Runtime (in-house, behind a seam)

The engine that *executes* a run. Built from scratch as the `native` runtime
behind a stable `RuntimeAdapter` seam, with a deterministic `reference` simulator
covering the UI throughout.

- **M2.1 — Run model** ✅ `e624ff0` — `AgentRun`/`RunStep`/`RunEvent`, a validated
  lifecycle state machine, and a runtime-neutral run service emitting the trace.
- **M2.2 — RuntimeAdapter seam** ✅ `cef1eb7` — the firewall + the `reference`
  adapter (deterministic simulator) + registry + orchestrator. Decision to build
  in-house locked in (`b1031de`).
- **M2.3 — Start-run API + live trace UI** ✅ `86da916` — dispatch an agent and
  watch the run trace; verified in-browser.
- **M2.4 — ModelClient** ✅ `3478505` — model-agnostic inference over raw HTTP
  (OpenAI-compatible; local *or* frontier), typed errors, retry/timeout, tool
  calls, streaming. No vendor SDK.
- **M2.5 — ToolRunner + Sandbox** ✅ `c7301d6` — the agent's guarded, isolated
  hands: git-worktree workspace (path-contained, bounded exec), guardrailed
  tools, errors-as-data.
- **M2.6 — ContextEngine** ✅ `e3a9c9f` — token efficiency: prefix-stable
  assembly, context editing, budget compaction.
- **M2.7 — LoopController → `native` adapter** ✅ `2312927` — composes Model +
  Tools + Sandbox + Context into the agentic loop with step/token safety rails;
  the in-house runtime executes end to end.
- **M2.8 — Finalize tools + repo-aware workspace** ✅ `6aabe5c` — `run_tests`,
  `git_commit` onto a per-run branch; runs operate on a real checkout.
- **M2.9 — open_pr + PR linking** ✅ `f65c762` — the GitProvider seam +
  `referenceGitProvider`; opens a PR and links it to the task (Linked PRs).
- **M2.10 — real `github` provider** ✅ `65ec146` — pushes the branch + opens a
  real PR via the REST API; token redacted from output.
- **M2.11 — run usage & cost** ✅ `232fa5a` — token usage captured on the run,
  surfaced via API + SDK; cost derived from a current pricing table.
- **M2.12 — per-project repo config** ✅ `29646f7` — PRs target each project's
  own repo (resolved from its GitHub integration); `defaultBranch`.
- **M2.13 — workspace clone management** ✅ `57cb3d0` — clone the project repo
  into a per-project cache, worktree from it; token never persisted to disk.
- **M2.14 — background execution** ✅ `caaa263` — runs execute detached (request
  returns QUEUED immediately); error isolation; adapter-aware cancel via
  `adapterId`; restart reaper.
- **M2.15 — GitHub App installation-token auth** ✅ `581db93` — short-lived,
  auto-rotating tokens (RS256 JWT → installation token, cached) preferred over a
  PAT.
- **M2.16 — cross-run memory** ✅ `9705890` — the runtime recalls prior project
  learnings into a stable context preamble and records run summaries;
  `capabilities().memory = true`.
- **M2.17 — Outcomes** ✅ — the agent grades its result vs the acceptance
  criteria and revises before requesting review (bounded by `maxRevisions`);
  `capabilities().outcomes = true`.
- **M2.18 — multi-agent** ✅ — the lead `delegate`s focused sub-objectives to
  worker sub-agents (orchestrator-worker / hub-and-spoke) with **isolated
  context**, the shared sandbox, bounded budget, and no-recursion guardrails;
  `capabilities().multiAgent = true`. **Native caps now all on: self-hosted ✓ ·
  memory ✓ · outcomes ✓ · multi-agent ✓.**
- **M2.19 — semantic RAG (local embeddings)** ✅ — memory recall upgraded from
  recency to **cosine similarity over local embeddings** (`nomic-embed-text` via
  Ollama, 768-dim): an `EmbeddingClient` (raw HTTP, local-only) + `lib/vector`
  (cosine / rank); the native adapter embeds the task to recall *relevant*
  learnings and embeds the summary on record. Degrades to recency when no
  embedding model is set. Verified live (0.70 same-meaning vs 0.37 unrelated).

## Part B — the Platform SDK (in-house, schema-first)

The typed client agents & integrations use to talk to Lumey. One contract →
TypeScript *and* generated Python, with a drift guard.

- **M3.1 — SDK TypeScript core** ✅ `a8ace1b` — schema-first contract (zod →
  inferred types), typed errors, idempotent writes, resilient transport,
  `tasks.next` / `runs.start|list|get|cancel`; verified end-to-end live.
- **M3.2 — Python codegen + more** ✅ `0b5b1d7` — generated dependency-free
  Python client; operations manifest + drift guard; resumable `runs.events`
  stream; illustrated SDK guide.
- **Run usage in the SDK** ✅ (with M2.11) — token fields + `runs.usage` with
  cost estimation; Python regenerated.

## Live verification

- **First live `native` run on a local model** — Ollama + `qwen2.5-coder:7b`,
  wired via `LUMEY_LOCAL_MODEL` (no code change — just config, proving the
  model-agnostic seam). A real run drove the loop end to end and the **Outcomes
  grade→revise loop was visible in the trace** (self-grade FAIL → revise →
  self-grade PASS → request review). Confirmed: small local models narrate tool
  use under complex prompts (a model-quality limit, not a runtime one) — a
  frontier model resolves it via the same seam.
- **Fix surfaced by the run:** local models default to a **300s** request
  deadline (a 7B cold-load alone is ~30–60s); env-override `LUMEY_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS`.

## Enterprise hardening — Phase 1 (Glass Cockpit)

Plan: [`docs/planning/ENTERPRISE-PLAN.md`](docs/planning/ENTERPRISE-PLAN.md).

- **P1.1 — SSE live run trace** ✅ — runs are no longer a polled black box. A
  **single-use, ~30s, run-scoped stream ticket** (minted over the Bearer-authed
  `POST …/stream-ticket`) authenticates a browser `EventSource` (which can't send
  headers); `GET …/stream` forwards the run's `run.*` bus facts **signal-only**
  (the client refetches the authoritative detail), with heartbeats + idempotent
  teardown on disconnect/terminal/cap. Frontend `useRunStream` live-invalidates
  the React Query caches + shows a "● live" pill; re-mints on reconnect (the
  ticket is single-use). Verified live end-to-end (events streamed as they
  happened; ticket replay → 401).
- **P1.2 — run pause/resume** ✅ — control follows visibility: a human can now
  **suspend a run in place and resume it**, not just kill it. A new `PAUSED`
  lifecycle state (`RUNNING ↔ PAUSED`) backs a **cooperative** suspend — a
  `PauseController` parks the agentic loop at its next *turn boundary* with the
  transcript + sandbox kept alive in memory, so resume continues exactly where it
  left off (a cancel still wins over a pause, so it never strands the loop).
  Orchestrator `pauseRun`/`resumeRun` flip the loop flag then move the DB
  (RUNNING-first on resume, so every later transition stays legal); guarded to a
  run that is RUNNING, **in-flight on this server**, and on a runtime that can
  suspend (the fire-and-forget `reference` adapter declines). The boot reaper now
  also fails interrupted `PAUSED` runs (their state is in-memory only). Wired
  through the SDK enum + Python, and the FE (Pause/Resume buttons + a "Paused"
  pill). Verified by mock-model loop tests (parks → resumes; cancel beats pause)
  + lifecycle/orchestrator/reaper units.

## Enterprise hardening — Phase 2 (Human-in-the-Loop)

Plan: [`docs/planning/ENTERPRISE-PLAN.md`](docs/planning/ENTERPRISE-PLAN.md).

- **P2.1 — clarification round-trip** ✅ — the first *two-way* collaboration: the
  agent can **ask a human a question mid-run and continue with the answer**. A new
  lead-only `ask_human` **control tool** is intercepted by the loop (never
  dispatched to the sandbox): it opens a `RunClarificationRequest` (PENDING),
  parks the run on **AWAITING_INPUT** via a `ClarificationController` (transcript
  + sandbox alive in memory, like pause but carrying an answer back), and on a
  human answer injects it as the tool result and resumes (AWAITING_INPUT →
  RUNNING). The human answers over `POST …/clarifications/:id/answer`, which wakes
  the parked loop **first** then persists ANSWERED (so a dead/raced run is
  rejected before it's marked answered); a cancel while waiting resolves the wait
  and finishes CANCELLED. The boot reaper now also fails interrupted
  AWAITING_INPUT runs and cancels their open questions. FE: the run card shows the
  agent's question with an inline answer box (live via the SSE invalidation).
  Verified by mock-model loop tests (ask → park → answer → resume; cancel-while-
  waiting → CANCELLED) + service/orchestrator units; backend boots with the new
  routes registered (401/403 gated, not 404).
